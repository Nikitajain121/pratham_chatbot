1. Initially we scrape main page using websrapper.py.
2. Save the output in output.txt
3. Now scrape links from output.txt which contain text data like html pages with text and pdf .
4. Store all of them in text format in data folder ignoring jpg and other files which can cause gibberish content.
5. Move output.txt to to data folder.
