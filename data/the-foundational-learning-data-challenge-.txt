# The foundational learning data challenge: A civil society view from the
Global South

12  Dec  2023

Suman Bhattacharjea, Director (Research), ASER Centre co-wrote a blog with
Ariel Fiszbein, Chair, Board of Directors, PAL Network. It addresses the
scarcity of internationally comparable data on early-grade literacy and
numeracy. Also, highlights the efforts of organizations like the Pratham
Education Foundation and the PAL Network, emphasizing initiatives such as the
Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) and Citizen-Led Assessments (CLAs) to
bridge this data gap.

"In 2019, supported by a Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (KIX) global grant,
PAL Network, Pratham Education Foundation in India and the Australian Council
for Educational Research (ACER) began work on developing the next entrant to
the PAL toolkit of common assessments. While ICAN mirrored the original CLA
vision of assessing foundational skills among school-aged children (age group
5-16), the Early Language, Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (PAL-ELANA)
focuses on children in the age group of 4-10 years, looking specifically at
children’s acquisition of pre- and foundational literacy and numeracy skills
in the period that bridges SDG target 4.2 (early childhood education) and SDG
indicator 4.1.1a (grades 2/3 of primary education)."
