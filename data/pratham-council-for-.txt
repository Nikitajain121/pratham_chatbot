# PRATHAM COUNCIL FOR VULNERABLE CHILDREN

The Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children (PCVC) is the child protection
vertical of Pratham with the vision of ‘**Every Child 's Rights Protected,
Every Child in School and Learning Well**.’

Started in 2001, PCVC’s focus has evolved from rescue and rehabilitation of
child labourers and children in difficult situations to adopting a rights-
based approach towards protection and safeguarding the rights  
of children.

### CONTEXT

PCVC started as an outreach program with extensive intervention work in the
urban communities of Mumbai consisting of poor migrant families.

**We identified thousands of working children between 6 and 18 years of age,
engaged in industries like bag-making, shoe-making, cap-making, zari, gold
polishing etc. Most of these children were migrants primarily belonging to
Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.**

The outreach’s major intervention was to rescue children in coordination with
the police and the Labour Department and persuading employers not to employ
children for work.

Extensive work was then carried out in both source states and destination
states of child labourers to mitigate child labour and help repatriated
children receive available compensation and  
rehabilitation facilities.

Over the years, PCVC strengthened its interventions, reaching not only to
child labourers but also children on move (unsafe migration of children,
runaway children, street children), children with disability, children
affected by natural or man-made calamities, children in institutions, children
suffering from substance abuse, children in conflict with law, child survivors
of sexual abuse and children belonging to the most  
marginalised communities.

Through its work,**PCVC strives to reduce the vulnerabilities so as to create
a safety net for children by strengthening the child protection mechanisms
through partnerships with government and non-government organisations.**

### REACH & SCALE

**PCVC 's activities extend to seven states in the country – Andhra Pradesh,
Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.**

![](https://pratham.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3.jpg)

In 2022-23, PCVC covered **54** **blocks** , **18****districts** (rural areas)
and **730****communities** in **9****cities** (urban areas). Overall, PCVC
reaches around **300,000** **children** annually through its direct and
indirect interventions.

### APPROACH

**PCVC strategy includes direct work with children and families in vulnerable
communities. Indirect work as a resource organisation involves training of
different stakeholders working in the field of child protection and
partnership with necessary government departments to address these concerns.**

PCVC addresses the issues of child rights through multipronged interventions.
PCVC’s overall focus is on **prevention, remediation, rehabilitation, policy
advocacy and documentation for evidence-based practice.**

One of the key programs of PCVC is to rescue child labourers from exploitative
situations. The aim is to repatriate these children back to their homes and
seek rehabilitative measures to sustain them in their local and home settings.
To facilitate this, PCVC has established various inter-state connections with
the respective government departments, at both source and receiving ends. PCVC
also works at important source and receiving points at railway stations in
order to mitigate unsafe migration and trafficking of children as a major
prevention operation.

On the rehabilitation front, PCVC provides educational sponsorship for the
rescued child labourers. This is for the children who attend school on a
regular basis (up to 70% attendance) and their progress is monitored by PCVC
staff in consultation with the schools. Another rehabilitation initiative is
the Family Assistance Project which provides livelihood to the families of
these vulnerable children to ensure the sustenance of children in education
net and protects them from getting into any harmful practices like child
labour. In the past, PCVC has run residential shelters for rescued child
labourers in their home state as a demonstration of best practices for the
state.

A crucial prevention program is the Child Rights Help Desk which is set up at
various locations to address the concerns of child rights and for local
community members to seek redressal for the same. Child rights sessions are
also conducted in schools as well as in the community to spread awareness on
the child protection concerns.

PCVC also engages in national advocacy-level interventions. These
interventions range from establishing inter-state coordination between various
state governments and pushing the issue of child rights and protection to a
higher priority on their agenda and working towards influencing significant  
policy decisions.
