###  Testimonial

![Charlotte](https://pratham.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Charlotte.jpg)

During my six months interning with the Program Management Group, I had the
opportunity to work with just a few of the smart, passionate and inspiring
people who make Pratham the organization it is. While I got to explore many
aspects of what PMG does, I mainly worked on research and evaluation
components of Pratham’s Early Years interventions. Through this work, I
participated in many interesting discussions with donors, research
collaborators and teams across the organization, cultivating useful skills
throughout. My time in the central office was supplemented by field visits to
rural and urban programs in six states, where I could see the successes and
challenges of implementation at scale. The learnings from my internship are
sure to influence my future, both personally and professionally, and I’m so
grateful to the everyone who enhanced my Pratham experience.

As a research intern working primarily on government partnerships, I loved the
independence I was given to tailor my internship experience and the
responsibility to initiate projects that would have a visible impact on
Pratham’s collaboration with the government. I was also privileged to learn
from an organisational culture which rewards strong work ethic and takes great
pride in its values, which helped me assume greater individual accountability.
Overall, my experience has been extremely rewarding in not only cementing my
interest in development, but also helping me build a broad professional skill-
set for the sector!

My summer internship at Pratham proved to be an unmatched learning experience.
I was encouraged to get hands-on experience and was presented with multiple
opportunities to do field work, reporting, research and even partner meetings
- all in the span of just one month. At Pratham I was also encouraged to take
initiative and ownership of tasks which helped me grow on a personal and a
professional level. I truly believe that interning at Pratham was one of the
best professional decisions I have taken so far.
