# Education

Pratham addresses gaps in education systems with innovative, low-cost,
replicable interventions that span the age spectrum. Working both directly and
through government systems, these programs collectively reach millions of
children and thousands of school dropouts each year. In “direct” work, a
Pratham instructor works with children either in the school or in the
community, whereas the “partnership” model involves Pratham teams working
closely with government teams at the state, district or city level to design
and implement programs. Pratham’s approach to improving learning outcomes
continues to serve as a model, both within India and beyond.
