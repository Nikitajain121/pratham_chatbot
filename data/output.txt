###  About Us

Pratham is an innovative learning organization created to improve the quality
of education in India. Established in 1995 to provide education to children in
the slums of Mumbai, Pratham has grown in both scope and scale, with programs
today reaching children and youth across the country.

As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, Pratham
focuses on high-quality, low-cost and replicable interventions to address gaps
in the education system. Working directly with children and youth as well as
through large-scale collaborations with government systems, Pratham programs
reach millions of lives every year. Pratham's [Teaching at the Right
Level](https://www.pratham.org/about/teaching-at-the-right-level/) (TaRL)
approach has demonstrated proven impact on children's learning outcomes and is
now being adapted to contexts outside India.
