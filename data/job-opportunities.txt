###  Testimonial

![Arjun](https://pratham.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Arjun.jpg)

**FROM PATNA TO PERU (AND BACK!)**

_My name is Arjun and I have been a part of the Program Management Group at
Pratham. Our team is at a rather interesting niche in the organization – we
interact with donors and manage those relationships, while also working with
and supporting field teams on program planning and implementation._

My three years at Pratham have been a rollercoaster. From spending hours on
train stations to eating guinea pigs in Peru to conducting elections in a
village in Uttar Pradesh, Pratham has exposed me to a range of experiences
that I could never have imagined. As I look back at my time in the
organization, while there have been (plenty of!) moments of frustration, I
would not have had it any other way.

I landed in Patna on a warm October night and caught a train to a district
called Jamui on the edge of the state. The purpose of my trip was to visit a
cluster of villages where local leaders had taken the initiative to work on
children’s learning.

I met the cluster head with Gunjan (the Pratham staff member leading the
initiative), and asked him what he would do if Pratham teams moved on from
that area. He responded that they would manage on their own and that he would
be that area’s Gunjan. This completely blew me away. Later, I sat under the
stars talking to villagers about their aspirations for children’s learning.
Their sheer enthusiasm and passion is forever ingrained in my memory.

Not long after this field trip, I found myself on a plane to Peru. Our team
was helping the Peruvian government pilot Pratham’s teaching-learning approach
in some rural schools. After a fair amount of travel, I reached a school in
rural Cajamarca. It was morning, and the day’s activities were about to begin.
I saw two boys come out of the classroom, collect some stones, and start
playing the ‘number wheel’ game. This activity is designed to help them
understand the concept of place value and had been taught in class the
previous day. This was really amazing!

After my time in Peru, I returned to India and soon went back in Patna
visiting new locations. The excitement of seeing people from India to Peru
use, adapt and implement our approach fueled me and kept me awake, despite the
jetlag.

When I look back at my time with Pratham, it has been the opportunity to work
together with an extremely diverse group of individuals that has been one of
the biggest highlights. From field staff in a corner of Bihar to leadership
teams sitting in Delhi and Mumbai, the organization has allowed me to interact
with–and more importantly learn from–a most incredible and passionate set of
individuals.

By working on programs and developing collaborations with governments (in
India or elsewhere), Pratham has given me the chance to really drive change
and make my voice count. More than anything though, it has shown me the power
of clear and focused action and convinced me that ambitious leaps in outcomes
are possible in a future not too far from us.

And that’s really exciting.

\- Arjun

**WHAT MAKES PRATHAM CLICK**

I gaze at a book called _In Search of Excellence_ on my table _,_ written by
two ex-McKinsey consultants on what makes great ‘corporations’ click and I’m
left in awe as to how Pratham, an NGO, has so intuitively, over and over again
for the better part of the last two decades, managed to create an environment
where everything _just clicks_.

Around this time last year, I knew little about the development sector. I’d
worked for two years in a consulting firm and was ready to apply my
_obligation to dissent_ to a bigger context. Tired of castigating our
politicians during after-work parties, I decided it was vital for me to get a
sense of how things worked on the ground _._ At the same time, I wanted to
stick to my core skill of data analysis. Measurement, Monitoring and
Evaluation seemed like a natural fit, and Pratham’s work in the area
immediately caught my attention.

**Humble Beginnings**

When I joined in October 2017, I was fortunate enough to be trusted with
Pratham’s flagship program, called _Read India_. I was told I’d be
collaborating with more than 40 people from 10 states across India, which at
the time seemed quite overwhelming! As I spent time with state-level MME
teams, I realized how much effort Pratham had put in to cultivate a strong
cadre of leaders in every state, an achievement few NGOs can boast of today.
Data is often conveniently left out of the conversation in the social sector,
yet here I was in an environment where people close to the field were
discussing how our intervention could be more effective if some additional
indicators were added to our monitoring formats1. I was humbled and elated to
witness how strongly people in Pratham--whether our leadership in Delhi or a
staff member in a remote village in Rajasthan--believed in the power of data
to make better decisions.

**Getting Into the Groove**

In April 2018, Pratham decided to shift its focus from learning in _schools_
to learning in _communities._ The goal, broadly defined, was to better
understand learning levels of all children in a village and work towards
improving those, involving community members in the process. That is no small
task when working in 14 different states (~3500 villages) with such diversity
in contexts. However, we realized we could either be discouraged by the
massive scale and complexity of this problem or break it down into simpler
pieces. The first step? Making sure community members understood the problem
of poor learning levels in the first place.

The solution we came up with was a _village report card_ , an assessment of
their own community’s learning levels led by village volunteers. From
designing the report card to piloting and translating it to training team
members at the state level who then conducted volunteer trainings, I was given
complete freedom to call the shots. In a span of 30 days, volunteers collected
data from 100,000 children across ~480 villages in 14 states2. Further, close
to 70% of this data was collected on a tablet-based application we built
within a week’s time! Somehow, yet again, _things just clicked_! From our CEO
to everyone on ground, it was heartening to get such tremendous support from
all ranks of the organisation, all aligned toward a unified goal. I was doing
some great work a year back too, but could I compare any of it to this
exercise? I doubt it.

**Every Child Learning Well**

As I pause the music on my phone, my colleague from our Assessment Unit
excitedly shares that one of our co-founders, Dr. Madhav Chavan, plans to make
learning modules on music for rural children to access via Android tablets in
their villages. ‘ _Why limit our work to Math and Science?’,_ he says. Another
new day, another new idea, another new experiment; practicing our _obligation
to dissent_ against traditional beliefs about education. This pretty much sums
up the one year I’ve spent at Pratham. People around me might be from a
variety of backgrounds, but it is our unshakeable faith in _every child
learning well_ that, I guess, makes Pratham click!

**THE MAGIC OF PRATHAM**

My journey with Pratham started in May of 2012, and although it has been some
time now, Pratham still makes every day feel anew. Pratham was my first job
out of university, so I was eager to absorb as well as apply my psychology
degree in the real world.

Over time, Pratham has gifted me with the opportunity to work in various
capacities. I started in the People Development Unit, where I contributed to
the creation of capacity building programs for people within Pratham. Most
importantly, this first position taught be that training can be a ‘tool for
change’. As I gained experience, I began creating content and training people
in conducting Life Skills sessions for adolescents, youth and adults. This
profile gave me a chance to develop content for children on various soft
skills and also work with many, many teachers across the organization.

With the learnings from the aforementioned experiences, I was provided a
platform to lead a girls’ education program working with Kasturba Gandhi
Balika Vidyalays (KGBVs). KGBVs are residential schools established for girls
for girls in Upper primary grades in economically and socially backward blocks
of the country. Pratham’s partnership with KGBVs is in three states: Uttar
Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Working in these three geographies gives me
immense satisfaction and a constant thirst to learn and then concretize my
learning. Be it seeing the KGBV girls speak confidently about a Science
experiment they learnt, hearing the stories of friendship and collaboration
with teachers and wardens or watching the way my own team of 50 women is
evolving in the process -- everything has been extremely fulfilling.

One of the best things that Pratham helped me understand is how to nurture
people. Looking at how my seniors have been with me and how they provided me
with a safe space to grow, I learned about the impact that strong, consistent
mentorship can have. Pratham works in the field of education, and even
internally I’ve been amazed at how much personal and professional growth is
possible here. The people in this organization are exceptional at facilitating
change, both externally and within. I believe these experiences of warmth and
guidance have been instrumental in translating the same in my own work.

In my journey of about six years now, Pratham blessed me with three
values:**trust, passion** and **resilience**. I see these in people at all
levels of Pratham, from the central team where I work to the state teams and
instructors across the country. Pratham trusts its people, the energy within
the organization is contagious and whenever we have a set-back, we bounce back
with energy!

All in all, the Pratham experience is a magical one: there is magic in the
work we do, the way we do it, the places Pratham takes us and the contentment
at the end of the day!
