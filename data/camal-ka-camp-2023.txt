# Camal Ka Camp 2023

![](https://pratham.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1.-Banner-image-1.jpg)

**What is CAMaL Ka Camp?**

_A Summer Catch-Up Camp for Children_

Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2022 data shows that only **42.8%**
of Grade V children can read text at Grade II level. This figure was **50.4%**
in 2018.

School enrollment of children in the 6-14 age group has progressively
increased over the years. It reached 96% in 2010 and remained that way till
the pandemic. While the problem of “every child in school” has been largely
solved, the goal of “every child learning well” is still far from being
achieved.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, ASER data showed that children's ability to
read or do basic arithmetic needed substantial strengthening in India.
Moreover, the pandemic exacerbated this issue, as prolonged school closures
and economic disruptions in families led to major learning gaps among children
(ASER 2022 data).

The summer of 2023 presented an **invaluable opportunity to address the issue
of learning gaps and help children before the next school year began.** CAMaL
ka Camp 2023 (CAMaL: Combined Activities for Maximized Learning) focussed on
students in Grade V transitioning to Grade VI in the academic year 2023-24, as
well as students in Grades IV and VI.

**During the six-week camp, children were engaged in various learning
activities to enable them to participate and communicate effectively.**

**What did we do?**

In the summer of 2023 (May-June), Pratham facilitated catch-up camps for
children transitioning from primary to the middle school through youth
volunteers and government support. The goal was that all children who
participated in the six-week camp would be able to read fluently with
understanding and that they should be able to express their thoughts orally
and in writing by the end of the camp.

Implemented across the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, the
summer camps witnessed overwhelming response, thanks to the concerted efforts
of over **300,000 dedicated volunteers** , predominantly **youth aged 16 to
20, studying in Grade XI-XII.**

Learning was made engaging through various activities. A warm-up involved
**simple learning games. Storytelling** and discussions followed, leading to
**writing activities**. Focus later shifted to letters and words with games
like **_Bara-khadi_**. Each child created a comprehensive dictionary with
words, meanings, sentences, and pictures. Math word problems concluded the
class.

## Highlights of 2023 Summer Camp

Government Collaboration

The formal support from the Education Departments of the Governments of Madhya
Pradesh and Bihar, as well as the continuous support received at the district
and sub-district levels in Uttar Pradesh, played a pivotal role in ensuring
the smooth execution of the summer camps.

Training and Technology

Every volunteer underwent short yet comprehensive training, equipped with a
detailed manual outlining all the activities to be conducted, including
resources such as para and story cards and QR codes to access short activity
videos. Additionally, they were provided with Hindi language tools and data
collection formats. To streamline the process, we employed a user-friendly
weblink for volunteer registration, profile updates, and assessment data
submission.

Monitoring and Evaluation

To maintain quality and accountability, our dedicated teams from Pratham and
government personnel conducted regular on-site visits and telephonic calls to
assess progress and verify assessment data submitted by volunteers. This
meticulous oversight ensured the credibility and reliability of our outcomes.

## Outcomes and Impact

The results have been nothing short of extraordinary. Each of the three states
witnessed at least a **24-percentage point** improvement in children's ability
to **read a Grade II level text after only four weeks of instructional
activities.** The impact has been far-reaching, sparking the need to build
from here and ensure a brighter future for these young children.
