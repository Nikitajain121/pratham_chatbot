# IAmPratham

![](https://pratham.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IAMPRATHAM-WB-BANNER-1.jpg)

Pratham reaches over 6 million children and youth annually. Behind these
figures, there exists a dedicated team of dedicated heroes – our foot
soldiers. These individuals are driven by an unwavering commitment to
Pratham's cause and mission. Our campaign **#IAmPratham** celebrates these
heroes and showcases their stories, challenges, and their aspirations. As we
celebrate Pratham's journey and work, let us applaud these heroes who make it
all happen.

These Pratham heroes, often working behind the scenes, are the true architects
of Pratham's success story. Their commitment extends beyond the boundaries of
conventional challenges, navigating through the complex terrain of socio-
economic disparities, educational inequalities, and geographic obstacles. In
the heart of communities, urban slums, and rural villages, they stand as
beacons of change, working tirelessly to ensure that learning doesn't stop.
Through tailored interventions, innovative teaching methodologies, and
community engagement, they form a cohesive network, each playing a pivotal
part in ensuring Pratham's endeavours are reaching the last mile. While we
showcase only a few of the stories, there are many others who are making a
difference every day of their life.
