### Daan Utsav 2023

# Daan Utsav 2023

Daan Utsav, celebrated annually from October 2 to October 8, is India’s
biggest festival of giving.

Our campaign **#BeAnInfluencer for Change** aims at redefining the concept of
an influencer - anyone who influences the behaviour of others - and
emphasizing the power of individuals to inspire positive change.

Change, whether big or small, can happen anywhere, and influencers come from
all walks of life. Through stories of resilience and transformation, we want
to celebrate people who have broken barriers, brought change, and emerged as
role models. They are the true influencers.

The campaign **#BeAnInfluencer for Change** is a call to embrace the spirit of
giving and use your influence to make a difference. By sharing inspiring
stories, we aspire to make this Daan Utsav truly impactful, bringing together
all segments of society.

Through Pratham's programs — [Early Childhood
Education](https://www.pratham.org/programs/education/early-childhood-
education/), [Vocational
Training](https://www.pratham.org/programs/education/vocational-training/),
and [Second Chance](https://www.pratham.org/programs/education/beyond-
elementary/) — here are six stories of extraordinary courage and commitment.
These individuals have overcome familial, societal, and economic challenges to
rebuild their lives, becoming influencers and role models with a helping hand
from Pratham.

You too can become an influencer. How?

**Support them. Amplify their voices. Share their stories.**
