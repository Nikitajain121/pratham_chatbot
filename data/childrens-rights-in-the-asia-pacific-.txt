# Children’s Rights in the Asia-Pacific Region: Critical Reflections on
Participation, Education, Girls’ Rights and Child Marriage

28  Nov  2023

Dr Rukmini Banerji has co-written an article titled 'Children’s Rights in the
Asia-Pacific Region: Critical Reflections on Participation, Education, Girls’
Rights and Child Marriage' published by The Canadian Journal of Children’s
Rights.

Dr Banerji reflects on how Pratham pioneered a profoundly different approach
to working toward the fulfilment of children’s education via the delivery of
the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) and a teaching approach called
Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL). She also explores the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on children's education and the need for immediate action to
address the repercussions of school closures. Additionally, she mentions the
positive outcome of increased parental engagement in children's education
during the pandemic.
