# Annual Status of Education Report

ASER Centre is Pratham’s autonomous research and assessment unit. The centre
promotes a culture of evidence-based decision making and seeks to develop and
use simple yet rigorous methods to generate evidence on scale on the outcomes
of social sector programs, especially education. It also aims to strengthen
the link between evidence and action by building the capacity of individuals
and institutions to design, conduct, understand and communicate the results of
assessments that focus on key outcome indicators.

### CONTEXT

The word “aser” (pronounced uh-sir) means “impact” in Hindi and in many Indian
languages. If development programs are to lead to desired outcomes, their
impact on the ground should be regularly assessed. Large sums of public money
are channelled into social sector programs. Information on how these
investments translate into outcomes on the ground is a major indicator to
evaluate their effectiveness.

Currently, independent, timely data on outcomes are not available, especially
at the district level. In addition, outside of urban India, there is an
enormous shortage of people able to design, implement, and understand the nuts
and bolts of assessment. ASER Centre was established to fill these critical
gaps.

### APPROACH

![](https://pratham.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1.jpg)

ASER Centre’s flagship activity is the **Annual Status of Education Report**
(commonly known as the ASER report), a household-based survey that collects
information on children’s schooling status and basic learning outcomes in
almost every rural district in the country.

The basic nationwide ASER survey is an enormous participatory exercise that
has involved about **500 organisations** and upwards of **25,000 volunteers**
every year since 2005. Estimates of children’s schooling and learning status
are generated at district, state and national levels. In 2016, ASER switched
to an alternate-year model where the ‘basic’ ASER is conducted in all rural
districts of the country every other year rather than annually. In the gap
years, a smaller survey (typically 1-2 districts per state) focuses on other
age groups and domains.

ASER is an annual source of data on children’s learning outcomes for India,
and is often credited with changing the focus of discussions on education from
inputs to outcomes. The ASER model has been adapted for use by organisations
in 14 other countries across three continents. These organisations came
together organically to form the People’s Action for Learning (PAL) Network,
with a secretariat housed in Nairobi.

In addition, **ASER Centre implements large- and small-scale research studies
addressing a variety of domains**. Conducted in collaboration with
institutions such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the MacArthur Foundation, the
University of Cambridge, Ambedkar University Delhi, and others, these studies
seek to generate evidence that is actionable by both policy makers and
practitioners.

ASER Centre also conducts a range of capacity building workshops on topics
related to collecting and using evidence for action, both within the Pratham
network as well as for partner organizations. Key features of all capacity-
building modules include the integration of classroom and field activities;
the constant movement between theory (or policy) and practice (or ground
reality); and the use of a variety of classroom techniques (individual, small
group and large group activities).

### REACH & SCALE

The basic ASER survey reaches almost every rural district in the country and
covers more than **15,000 villages** and **650,000 children** (the sample size
is more than twice that of the survey rounds conducted by the government’s
National Sample Survey Organization). Other research, assessment and capacity-
building projects vary in reach and scale.

In the intervening years, ASER focuses on different aspects of children’s
education and learning. For instance, in 2017 and 2023, the survey focused on
the enrollment patterns, learning levels, awareness and aspirations of rural
youth aged 14-18 years. In 2019 and 2022, it focused on enrollment and school
readiness of young children aged 4-8 years.
