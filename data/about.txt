# About Us

###  Introduction

Pratham is an innovative learning organization created to improve the quality
of education in India. As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in
the country, Pratham focuses on high-quality, low-cost, and replicable
interventions to address gaps in the education system. Established in 1995 to
provide education to children in the slums of Mumbai, Pratham has grown both
in scope and geographical coverage.

Pratham means 'first' in Sanskrit. True to its name, it is the first major
organization to achieve lasting, wide-scale success in India's educational
landscape. This has been made possible due to various policies and strategies
adopted by the organization.

### Dedicated To Large-Scale Change

The mission to improve the quality of education in India and ensure that all
children not only attend but also thrive in school is being accomplished by
working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents,
teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Our programs aim to
supplement rather than replace governmental efforts. They are implemented on a
large scale to not only reach as many children as possible, but also to create
an adoptable demonstration model for state governments.

### A Focus on Innovation

Pratham's strategies reconfigure teaching methodologies, break down
traditional tactics,  
and challenge the current rote learning mechanisms in our schools. Our
programs are innovative and outcome-driven. In its early years Pratham
developed innovative teaching-learning approaches, materials, and measurement
methods. In 2005, we pioneered a nationwide survey of schooling and learning
that has had a major impact on national and international policy discussions.

### Low-Cost, Replicable Models

Pratham has worked to develop low-cost, replicable models that can easily
spread and be adopted by other organizations. Thousands of volunteers work
with Pratham to implement learning interventions at the grassroots level.
These volunteers are mobilized, trained, and monitored by the Pratham team.
They are also provided with teaching-learning material and books developed by
Pratham. Not only does this ensure more effective implementation of the
programs, but it also helps to build an infrastructure focused on providing
quality education to children.

### Programs Results and Accountability

All programs are designed to ensure that learning levels in schools and
communities increase, education reaches all children who are in school or
unable to use school facilities, and youth get well trained for job
opportunities. Testing tools are also developed by the Pratham team to check
the learning levels of children so as to determine the course of action best
suited to each child and to assess impact of our programs.
