# Learning Readiness & Catch Up

Pratham's campaign to re-start learning in a fun and engaging way

## **Pratham’s Community-based Campaign for Learning Readiness & “Catch-up”**

**August-September-October 2021**

![](https://www.pratham.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/p-logo-mask.png)

###  Introduction

Due to the pandemic, pre-schools and schools across the country have now been
closed for more than a year. Teachers have attempted to send children learning
materials using whatever means were available. At their end, families have
tried to support the education of their children in the best way they could.
Yet, there is widespread agreement that these efforts have been largely
ineffective and significantly uneven. Across the globe, there is serious
concern about whether all children will come back to school when once schools
reopen. Schools, families, and policymakers are worried about the impact of
the pandemic on children’s socio-emotional development and the extent of
learning loss that may have occurred.

As far as schooling is concerned, the COVID crisis has brought unprecedented
challenges: for example, children who are enrolled in Grade II today have
never been to school and possibly have not had much exposure to pre-school
education either. Children in today’s Grade V were finishing Grade III when
the pandemic struck. Data from India indicates that even in 2018, more than
half of all children in Grade IV could not read a Grade II level text or
perform simple 2-digit subtraction. It is very likely at the situation will
have worsened in the past year and a half.  

###  Pratham’s Community-based Campaign

By June-July in a regular year, summer vacations are over, and schools have
re-opened after the holidays. Children look forward to this time. Keeping in
mind this usual school calendar timeline, and aligned with the expectations of
children, parents, and teachers, we at Pratham feel it is time for learning to
begin again – and importantly, in a fun and engaging way!

To this end, whether schools open or not, during August & September Pratham
will carry out a community-based learning campaign in over 10,000 rural and
urban communities across the country. The campaign rolled out across the
country in the beginning of August 2021, and is encouraging parents and family
members as well as others in the community to join children, engage with them
in interesting and fun activities, and help them learn.

###  Campaign Goals

The campaign has two focus areas:

**(1) Early years learning readiness** for children currently in Grade I and
II; via mothers individually and in groups

**(2) “Catch up”** campaign for children currently in Grade III to VI via
local volunteers who conduct instructional activities and games with small
groups in the neighborhood. Volunteers or youth are conducting [**Mohalla Math
Learning Camp**](https://www.pratham.org/mmlc-package/) this month and will be
conducting the Mohalla Language Learning Camp in September to help children
build/re-build foundational reading and math skills.

**_The campaign will be carried out in over 10,000 communities in August and
September. Given the uncertainty around movement due to the pandemic, the team
is working through multiple scenarios as described below._**

###  POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

Based on the experiences of the past year, there are three likely scenarios
outlined below: **_It is likely that any of these scenarios may prevail at any
time,_** and hence the education sector needs to be prepared. After a year of
school closure, we should be in a position to answer questions like What kind
of activities are possible in each scenario? And with what kind of outcomes?
Here are the possible scenarios:

  * **Complete lockdown:** Only remote activity is possible.
  * **Restricted movement:** Local movement possible. Teachers are in school but not children.
  * **No restrictions:** Teachers and children can both come to school.

Pratham’s current community learning campaign will contribute to finding some
of these answers in the next few months, especially in terms of what can be
achieved in communities by local people.

###  PRATHAM’S OUTREACH STRATEGIES to support children’s learning

  * **Home connect:** Daily phone messages are going directly to families. Ongoing follow-up and feedback conversations with each family are being done. The content for the messages is aligned with the overall goals for this phase.
  * **Mohalla/neighborhood activity:** Volunteers are interacting with small groups of children for 1-1.5 hours a day doing simple instructional activities and games. Mothers of younger children are meeting weekly to share experiences and do activities together.
  * **Community support:** Panchayats, local Anganwadi workers, pre-school instructors, and schoolteachers are being informed. Content & activities shared with them, and their support sought.

**__****_In addition to the primary goal of addressing children’s learning
needs, Pratham is also initiating special exercises for community volunteers
so that capability for digital interactions is enhanced in these communities
for future work._**

###  EDUCATION for EDUCATION

As part of Pratham’s Education for Education program (EfE), volunteers who
give time for helping children learn are being offered a basic course in
digital literacy. The course is available to interested volunteers and
mothers. After registering on Pratham Digital’s YouthNet portal, a participant
completes the course via online content and assignments. The course will cover
basic digital knowledge like: Internet behaviour, WhatsApp, email, zoom and
uploading data.

**_Whether schools open or not, keeping safety of all in mind, we hope that
Pratham’s community campaign for learning will help young children “leap
forward” and older children “catch up”. These community-based activities can
act as a “warm up” before school opens. A rise in overall digital capability
will enable families and communities to support their children and to
accompany them on their journey of growth and development, in school and in
life._**
