# Second Chance

### SECOND CHANCE PROGRAM

### INTRODUCTION

India has achieved almost universal enrollment at primary schooling, however,
the trend does not sustain as children graduate to secondary grades and
upwards. Over the last decade or so, girls have dropped out of school
disproportionately due to factors like early marriage, chores at home and cost
of education [National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21)[
data](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/girls-drop-out-of-schools-due-
to-early-marriage-house-work/articleshow/92195487.cms)].

Pratham’s experience indicates that once a learner has dropped out of school,
it is near impossible for them to find their way back. While India has open
schooling opportunities, there is lack of awareness, accessibility, adequate
motivation and support for a student to use open schooling as a way to
continue their education.

Fewer people progressing for higher studies, low quality secondary education,
an ever-increasing demand of a skilled labour force reinforces the need for an
effective intervention in the secondary education space. **A secondary school
certificate is a prerequisite for entry into higher education, skill
apprenticeship and for promotion in jobs.** Pratham believes that by making
education accessible and closer to home, it is possible to overcome logistical
and social challenges and begin to bridge the gender gap in learning and
education.

Understanding the importance of secondary education, especially Grade 10,
Pratham has deployed a focused intervention, the Second Chance program, to
enable young girls and women to complete their secondary schooling and forge
strong pathways for the future.

### A JOURNEY OF EMPOWERMENT

### Approach

Pratham's Second Chance program focuses on providing school dropouts,
especially young girls and women, another chance at education. Second Chance
aims to support those who could not complete their secondary education. The
program focuses on completion of Grade 10. The academic certificate that they
receive opens the door for further opportunities for lifelong learning and
growth. The Second Chance program uses innovative teaching methods, to provide
accessible learning opportunities very close to where the students live.

### DELIVERY MODELS

The Second Chance program prepares and supports students to take the Grade 10
- Secondary Board/Open School examinations. The program runs in two phases.
The first phase is called the **Foundation Course (FC)** which lasts for 3-4
months and focuses on basic foundational concepts of subjects like **English,
Mathematics, Language (state-specific), Science and Home Science**. Assessment
in the form of a pre-test at the onset of FC and post-test at the end of FC
are conducted to track the learning levels of students and their growth during
the course. During this phase, life skills-focused activities are also
conducted with the learners, concentrating on enhancement of communication,
decision-making and critical thinking skills.

After the Foundation Course, students move to the **Main Course** which
focuses on helping learners prepare for the **Board-mandated curriculum**. The
progress during the Main Course is tracked through internal assessments.
Interactive methods such as activity-based learning, group work and an
emphasis on self-learning are the highlights of the course. The Main Course
formally ends with the students appearing for the Board Examination.

Additionally, the program delivers non-academic modules focused on providing
learners exposure to available opportunities after Grade 10.
